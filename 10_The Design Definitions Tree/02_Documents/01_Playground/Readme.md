# Playgrounds

If you place a document called `playground.md` amongst your [documents](/The-Design-Definitions-Tree/Documents) for one [aspect](/The-Design-Definitions-Tree/Aspects) in the design defintions tree, its contents will be displayed in a large [Playground](The-Design-Definitions-Tree/Documents/Components/Playground) on the top of the aspect’s page in DSK. This is helpfull to display a general demo of the aspect, so your users can immediatly see what the aspect is about. You can see an example of this in the documentation for some of the frontend’s documentation components, e.g. the [Banner](The-Design-Definitions-Tree/Documents/Components/Banner).
