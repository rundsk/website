## Bugs and Enhancements

Combining great new ideas with experience will help us create the best possible
features for DSK. Likewise, talking through a bug with a team member will help
us ensure the best possible fix. We're striving to maintain a lean, clean core
and want to avoid introducing patches for symptoms of an underlying flaw.

Found a bug? [Open an issue in our
tracker](https://github.com/atelierdisko/dsk/issues/new) and label it as a
_bug_.

Have an idea for a new killer feature? [Open an issue in our
tracker](https://github.com/atelierdisko/dsk/issues/new) and use the
_enhancement_ label.

## Business Support 

DSK is designed and developed by [Atelier Disko](https://atelierdisko.de), a
German design and software studio based in Hamburg and Berlin, with experience
in building and maintaining Design Systems.

Donâ€™t worry, you can use DSK on your own, but if you would like some help with
creating a Design System for your organization, or want paid commercial support for
running DSK on a secret business project, contact [Atelier Disko](https://atelierdisko.de/contact).
