# Special files: componentdemo.md
If you place a file called `playground.md` amongst your docs for one aspect in the design defintions tree, its contents will be displayed in a large Component Demo on the top of the aspect’s page in DSK. This is helpfull to display a general demo of the aspect, so your users can immediatly see what the aspect is about. You can see an example of this in the documentation for some of the frontend’s special components, e.g. the [Banner](/The-Frontend/Special-Components/Banner).
