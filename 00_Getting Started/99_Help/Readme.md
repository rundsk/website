## Bugs and Enhancements

Combining great new ideas with experience will help us create the best possible
features for DSK. Likewise, talking through a bug with a team member will help
us ensure the best possible fix. We're striving to maintain a lean, clean core
and want to avoid introducing patches for symptoms of an underlying flaw.

Found a bug? [Open an issue in our
tracker](https://github.com/rundsk/dsk/issues/new) and label it as a
_bug_.

Have an idea for a new killer feature? [Open an issue in our
tracker](https://github.com/rundsk/dsk/issues/new) and use the
_enhancement_ label.
