# The Design Definitions Tree

One of the fundamental ideas in DSK was to use the filesystem as the interface for content creation. This enables _direct manipulation_ of the content and frees us from tedious administration interfaces.

The _design definitions tree_ (DDT for short), is a tree of
directories and subdirectories. Each of these directories stands for
a _design aspect_ in the hierarchy of your design system, these might
be actual components, when you are documenting the user interface, or
chapters of your company's guide into its design culture.

Each directory may hold several files to document these design aspects: a
configuration file to add meta data or supporting _assets_ that can
be downloaded through the frontend.

```
example
├── AUTHORS.txt                 <- authors database, see "Authors" below
├── DataEntry
│   ├── Button                  <- "Button" design aspect
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── TextField               <- "TextField" design aspect
│   │   ├── Password            <- nested "Password" design aspect
│   │   │   └── readme.md
│   │   ├── api.md              <- document
│   │   ├── exploration.sketch  <- asset
│   │   ├── meta.yml            <- meta data file
│   │   ├── explain.md          <- document
│   │   └── unmask.svg          <- asset
```

_Note_: Hidden directories and files beginning with a dot (`.`) are ignored. 
Things you don't want to be accessed should not be stored inside the DDT.
