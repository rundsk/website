# Documenting Design Aspects

Aspects are documented by adding
[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) formatted
documentation files to their directory. A `readme.md` file may describe
an aspect or give clues how to use a certain component. You can split documentation
over several files when you like to. We usually use `api.md`, `explain.md` or
`comments.md`.

_Note_: `readme.md` is in no ways treated specially by DSK, but is usually displayed by
GitHub as the primary document in the web interface. 

_Another note_: If you prefer plain HTML documents over Markdown, these are
supported too. For this use `.html` instead of `.md` as the file
extension.
