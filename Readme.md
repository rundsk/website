# Design System Kit

Using the Design System Kit you quickly define and organize
_design aspects_ into a browsable and live-searchable design system.
Hierarchies between design aspects are established using plain
simple directories. Creating documentation is as easy as adding a
[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) formatted
file to a directory inside the _design definitions tree_.
