> When confronted with the task to create a Design System from scratch we
> were unable to find a tool to satisfy our demands in a suitable way. In
> this talk we’ll share general successful principles discovered while
> building DSK, a Design System Tool.
> 
> We’re going to give a demo, and will then quickly deep dive into each of
> our principles. Some of them are “Low Barriers/High Ceilings”,
> “Interoperability” or “Expecting Uncertainty”.
> 
> Finally, we hope to introduce people already involved with design tools
> to a way of developing a product and encourage others to start building
> their own Design System Tools.

> When confronted with the task to create a Design System from scratch we
> found ourselves pondering this very question. Unable to find a tool
> satisfying our demands in a way suitable, we've created DSK as
> a workbench for collaboratively creating Design Systems.
